## This project

- Couldn't be possible without the guys from [Selfstarter](https://github.com/lockitron/selfstarter). 
- The origin was preserved (including the name of the app, git commits), but with huge adaptations for the Brazilian reality.
- Is heavilly dependent on Moip Assinaturas. Go check at: http://site.moip.com.br/assinaturas/
- It's in English. Universal language, you know.

## Initial Roadmap

### Highest
- Cucumber specs, to check the form
- Jasmine specs, to check javascripts
- An admin to create Project or Projects.

### Minor
- A way to get webhooks from moip after order submits.
- An admin/dashboard to check current progress, social engagement and clicks.
- Improve form, because hidden labels can lead to misinterpretation.

## Todos

- Cleanup duplicated code. Always
- Improve tests. We have a slow coverage now (only 76%).
